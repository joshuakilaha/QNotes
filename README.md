# QNotes
 Quick Notes Application - using Core Data SwiftUI
 
 ## Core Data
 Persist or cache data on a single device, or sync data to multiple devices with Cloudkit

## Overview
Use Core Data to save your application’s permanent data for offline use, to cache temporary data, and to add undo functionality to your app on a single device. To sync data across multiple devices in a single iCloud account, Core Data automatically mirrors your schema to a CloudKit container.
Through Core Data’s Data Model editor, you define your data’s types and relationships, and generate respective class definitions. Core Data can then manage object instances at runtime to provide the following features.
## Persistence
Core Data abstracts the details of mapping your objects to a store, making it easy to save data from Swift and Objective-C without administering a database directly.
